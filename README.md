# Software engineering - Restaurant - Project
The project was done with a group colleague as part of the Software engineering course for the Military University of Technology

This project consisted of creating a UML diagram, with its description, of the restaurant's operating system. 
This system would be accessible to any of the restaurant's employees. Depending on his or her position, 
each would have different functions that facilitate the work in this restaurant. 
A detailed description of such a system, of the various functions, can be found in the report.
